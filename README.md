# 🌸  About Me

• **Hi, I'm Kori** — a Software Engineering student at *Universidad de La Salle, Colombia*.  
• A developer in training, passionate about creating things that make sense both logically and emotionally.  

I enjoy exploring how technology and creativity intersect how logical systems can express emotion, and how design influences human experience.  
Currently focused on learning full-stack development and strengthening my understanding of software architecture, clean code, and human-centered design.  
Every project I build is part of a journey to grow both technically and personally.

### 🥢 Philosophy 

“Finding meaning through creation”  
Every project, no matter how small, is a step toward understanding how technology connects people, ideas, and emotions.  
I aim to build things that matter — both to me and to those who use them.

### 🪷 Personal Project

**Project Sumi** a long-term, personal AI companion project exploring emotion, logic, and identity through code.  
It’s a private journey meant to grow with me over time.
